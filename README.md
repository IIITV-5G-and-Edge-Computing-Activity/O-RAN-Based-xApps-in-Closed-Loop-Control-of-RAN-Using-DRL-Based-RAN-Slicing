## Project Description
This project explores the implementation and analysis of Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) using the ns-O-RAN simulation platform. It focuses on integrating Near-RT RIC and Non-RT RIC components with custom xApps to enable closed-loop control for 5G networks. 

The study employs mmWave technology and E2 termination to achieve real-time communication between RAN components, emphasizing:
- Network optimization
- Resource management
- Low latency and high reliability

The project demonstrates the practical viability of O-RAN architecture and highlights its advantages over traditional RAN solutions, such as:
- Vendor neutrality
- Modularity and flexibility
- Integration of AI/ML solutions for dynamic resource allocation

### Key Components:
1. **ns-3 Integration**: Utilizes the ns3-mmWave version and ns-O-RAN module for detailed 5G simulations.
2. **E2 Interface**: Supports real-time communication between RIC and RAN components.
3. **RIC and xApp Setup**: Implements xApps for control logic and performance optimization.
4. **Closed-Loop Control**: Simulates traffic steering and mobility management using E2 Service Models.
